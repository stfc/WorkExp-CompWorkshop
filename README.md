# Overview:
The course was based around the free book “Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python 3rd Edition” by Al Sweigart (ISBN-10 0982106017). The book, and model code, is available for free online: https://inventwithpython.com/

The software used, Python and Pygame, are open source and freely available online: https://www.python.org/ and http://www.pygame.org/. NOTE that the version of python and pygame installed must be compatible with one another – the workshop used python-3.2 and pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py3.2.
